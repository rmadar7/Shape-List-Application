# Shape-List-Application
This was my final project for my Java course.

My goal was to create a program which would have a GUI and allow the user to add a shape, to which I've programmed in, to a list. The user is able to give dimensions of the shape, and in return, get the area and circumference, or the volume and surface area.

I've included all class files. The main method is located in the ShapeApp.java class file.
